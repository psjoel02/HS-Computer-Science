<h1>Excerpt from Martin Luther King's "I Have a Dream" Speech</h1>
<span>And so even though we face the difficulties of today and tomorrow, I still have a <mark>dream</mark>. It is a <mark>dream</mark><br>deeply rooted in the American <mark>dream</mark>.</span>
<p></p>
<span>I have a <mark>dream</mark> that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: "<font color="red">We<br>hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal</font>."</span>
<p></p>
<span>I have a <mark>dream</mark> that one day on the red hills of Georgia, the sons of former slaves and the sons of<br>former slave owners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood.</span>
<p></p>
<span>I have a <mark>dream</mark> that one day even the state of Mississippi, a state sweltering with the heat of injustice,<br>sweltering with the heat of oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice.</span>
<p></p>
<span>I have a <mark>dream</mark> that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged<br>by the color of their skin but by the <font size="6">content of their character</font>.</span>
<p></p>
<span>I have a <mark>dream</mark> today!</span>
<p></p>
<span>I have a <mark>dream</mark> that one day, down in Alabama, with its vicious racists, with its governor having his<br>lips dripping with the words of "interposition" and "nullification" -- one day right there in Alabama<br>little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls as<br>sisters and brothers.</span> 
<p></p>
<span>I have a <mark>dream</mark> today!</span>
<p></p>
<span>I have a <mark>dream</mark> that one day every valley shall be exalted, and every hill and mountain shall be made<br>low, the rough places will be made plain, and the crooked places will be made straight; "<font color="red">and the<br>glory of the Lord shall be revealed and all flesh shall see it together.</font>"</span>
