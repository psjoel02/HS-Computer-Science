<p>Benjamin Franklin wrote,<q>Any society that would give up a little liberty to gain a little security will deserve neither and lose both.</q></p>
<p>Walt Disney once said,<q> The way to get started is to quit talking and begin doing.</q></p>
<p>Martin Luther King, Jr. said,<q>The ultimate measure of a man is not where he stands in moments of comfort, but where he stands at times of challenge and controversy.</q></p>
<p>In a speech at the dedication ceremony for the cemetery at Gettsyburg Abraham Lincoln addressed the crowd</p>
<p>with these words:</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty,</p>
<p>and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.</p>
<p>Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and</p>
<p>dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great battle-field of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion</p>
<p>of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live. It is altogether</p>
<p>fitting and proper that we should do this.</p>
<p>But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate -- we can not consecrate -- we can not hallow -- this ground. The</p>
<p>brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or</p>
<p>detract. The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did</p>
<p>here. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have</p>
<p>thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us -- that</p>
<p>from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of</p>
<p>devotion -- that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain -- that this nation, under God,</p>
<p>shall have a new birth of freedom -- and that government of the people, by the people, for the people,</p>
<p>shall not perish from the earth.</p>
