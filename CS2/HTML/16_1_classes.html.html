<h1>Java While Loop</h1>

<p>Java while loops can be classified into two categories: counter-controlled loops and sentinel-controlled<br>loops.</p>
<h2>Counter-Controlled Loop</h2>
<p></p>
<p>A counter-controlled loop is a loop that repeats a predetermined number of times. The condition of<br> this type of loop is controlled by a counter variable. A counter is a variable that keeps count of the<br> number of times a loop is executed. Look at the following example of a counter-controlled loop.</p>
<div class = "code">
int counter = 1; 

while(counter <= 10) 
{ 
System.out.println(counter); 
counter++; 
} 
</div>
<p></p>
<h2>Sentinel-Controlled Loop</h2>
<p></p>
<p>A sentinel-controlled loop is a loop that executes an undetermined number of times. To stop the loop, a user<br> enters a value, called a sentinel, which causes the loop's condition to become false. Look at the following<br> example of a sentinel-controlled loop.
<div class = "code">
Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in); 
String ans = ""; 

while(!ans.equals("stop")) 
{ 
ans = sc.nextLine(); 
}
</div>
